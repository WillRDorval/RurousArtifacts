## Artifacts

### Artifact of Ego

Each stage, a random item from your inventory is selected to gain the
absorption properties of egocentrism, causing one (configurable) random item in your inventory
to be turned into the selected item each minute (configurable). This is reset each stage so only one item will
have the property at a time

### Artifact of Caffeination

At the beginning of each stage you gain one (configurable) mocha
but all enemies will also spawn with the number of mochas that it hsa given to you.
Can be set to scale in multiplayer so the number of mochas the enemies get is scaled by the number
of players in the lobby. The item name used to find mochas can be changed so you can use a custom modded item
instead of vanilla mochas (or any item if you so desire). Can be set to only give enemies mochas
for a more challenging experience.
